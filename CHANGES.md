# Game Interface Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Created a common interface for all games:
   - Created a new file `boardGPT/games/game_interface.py` that defines the `GameInterface` abstract base class
   - The interface includes methods for:
     - Getting valid moves (`get_valid_moves`, `is_valid_move`, `has_valid_moves`)
     - Making moves (`make_move`, `make_random_move`)
     - Coordinate conversion (`coords_to_notation`, `notation_to_coords`)
     - Game state representation (`show`, `is_game_over`, `get_moves`)

2. Modified OthelloGame to inherit from the interface:
   - Updated imports in `othello_simulator.py` to include `GameInterface`
   - Changed the class definition to inherit from `GameInterface`
   - Updated the `make_random_move` method with proper docstring and type hints

3. Updated package exports:
   - Modified `boardGPT/games/__init__.py` to expose the new `GameInterface` class
   - Added `OthelloGame` to the exports in `boardGPT/games/__init__.py`

4. Created a test script:
   - Added `test_game_interface.py` to verify that `OthelloGame` correctly implements the interface

5. Modified `generate_game` function to support multiple game types:
   - Added a `game_type` parameter to specify which game to generate
   - Created a mapping of game names to game classes
   - Updated the function implementation to use the specified game type
   - Added validation to check if the specified game type is supported
   - Created a test script `test_generate_game.py` to verify the functionality

## Benefits

1. **Standardization**: All game implementations will now follow a consistent interface, making it easier to work with different games.

2. **Code Reuse**: Common functionality can be shared across different game implementations.

3. **Extensibility**: New games can be added by implementing the interface, ensuring they provide all necessary methods.

4. **Maintainability**: The interface clearly defines what methods each game must implement, making the codebase more maintainable.

## Future Work

1. Implement the interface for other games (e.g., Chess, Checkers, Go).
   - The system is now ready to support multiple games through the `generate_game` function
   - Need to complete the implementation of other game classes that inherit from `GameInterface`

2. Consider adding more methods to the interface as needed for common game operations.

3. Create utility functions that work with any game implementing the interface.

4. Expand the game type mapping in `generate_game` as new game implementations are added.
